Simple scripts to make working with quagga a bit nicer.

Place scripts into /root/peering-scripts/ and then source the .bashrc file in your shell.

Works best with later versions of quagga ("show run" doesn't work otherwise)

This allows doing cisco-esque include/begin/section etc, eg:

[root@router1 ~]# show run | s ospf
debug ospf6 lsa unknown
router ospf
 ospf router-id 10.110.1.222
 redistribute connected
 network 10.110.1.208/30 area 0.0.0.0
 network 10.110.1.212/30 area 0.0.0.0
 network 10.110.1.220/30 area 0.0.0.0
!
[root@router1 ~]#


[root@router1 ~]# show run | i 10.110.1.222
 ip address 10.110.1.222/30
 bgp router-id 10.110.1.222
 ospf router-id 10.110.1.222
[root@router1 ~]# 


Also included is an "addPeer" script, useful for adding new peering sessions. Pass in a selection of IPs and it will check which ones are on a shared subnet, and add some basic bgp peering for them. (No password or max-prefix yet)


The last extra is "bgpsum" which is just a command that runs both "show ip bgp" and "show ipv6 bgp" commands together.
